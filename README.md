## 📖 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The model uses the dimensions of the sepals and petals as input features to make predictions.

## 📊 Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples with four features each:
- 🌿 Sepal Length
- 🌿 Sepal Width
- 🌸 Petal Length
- 🌸 Petal Width

The dataset is available in the public domain and can be accessed from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris).

## 🧠 Model
The model is built using Scikit-Learn. It includes the following steps:
1. 🔄 Data Preprocessing
2. 🏋️‍♂️ Model Training
3. 📊 Model Evaluation
4. 🚀 Model Deployment

## ⚙️ Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adiban17/Iris-Prediction-Model.git
   cd your-repository-name
   
## 🚀 Usage
To use the model for predictions, run the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📈 Results
The model achieves an accuracy of 96.66666666666667% on the test dataset.
